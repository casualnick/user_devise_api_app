# Devise user application

This is api-only devise user application created with RAILS 6.0. This aplication is based on JSON structure. I am using custom authentcation token in order to authenticate users. Application is connected with Facebook via koala gem. It also allow Users reviews books and attach files to  them. Aplication is tested with Postman. I've also added RSpec tests.
